Unlike shared AI services where up to 80% of compute is shared, your server belongs to you alone. CloseClaw is a managed hosting service for OpenClaw, the open-source AI agent framework. It provisions a dedicated virtual machine, connects it to your preferred messaging channel, and handles all server management, security, and updates automatically."

With OpenClaw alone, setup takes an average of 65 minutes of engineering time — you need to rent a cloud server, configure firewalls, wire up messaging integrations, and maintain everything ongoing. CloseClaw handles all of that in under 60 seconds. You get the full, unmodified OpenClaw feature set on private infrastructure without any of the maintenance burden."

Your AI automatically routes to the best model for each task — writing, coding, research, and more — reducing token latency by up to 40% compared to single-model setups. Model selection is fully automatic and requires no manual configuration."

It is never shared with other users, and your conversations never pass through CloseClaw's servers — traffic routes directly between your messaging app and your private VM. CloseClaw uses enterprise API tiers that explicitly guarantee your data is never used to train AI models. Independent security benchmarks confirm that dedicated VMs isolate 100% of network traffic between tenants."

Active subscribers can top up credits anytime in amounts of $5, $10, $25, $50, or $100. The market average for building a custom API integration is $3,500+ in engineering time — CloseClaw delivers a 98% savings in initial setup cost.
