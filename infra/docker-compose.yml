# ============================================================================
# CloseClaw — Gateway VM Docker Compose (deployed to GCP pool VMs)
#
# This template is deployed to ~/openclaw/docker-compose.yml on each VM
# by pool-create.sh. It overrides the upstream openclaw docker-compose with:
#   - network_mode: host  (required for device pairing auto-approval)
#   - proxy-only runtime  (VM does not hold provider API keys)
#
# The VM's .env must contain:
#   OPENCLAW_IMAGE, OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN, OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND,
#   OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR, OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR
# ============================================================================
